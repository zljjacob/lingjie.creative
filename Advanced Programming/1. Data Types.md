## 1 Initialization of variables

### 1.1 What are data types?

"Data types" refer to the classification of data in computer science, specifying the type of values that data can hold, as well as the operations that can be performed on it. In most programming languages, data types can be categorized into the following common types:

| Data Type   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Integer     | Used to represent integer values, such as integer (int), long integer (long), short integer (short), etc. |
| Floating Point | Used to represent decimal values, such as single-precision floating point (float), double-precision floating point (double), etc. |
| Character   | Used to represent a single character, such as character (char). |
| Boolean     | Used to represent true or false, such as boolean(bool). |
| Array       | Used to store a collection of multiple elements of the same type. |
| Struct      | Used to store multiple data members of different types. |
| Enumeration | Used to define a set of symbol constants with a specific range of values.                             |
| Class       | Used to define a data structure that includes properties and methods. |
| Interface   | Used to define a specification of methods for classes to implement. |
| Pointer     | Used to store the memory address of a variable, commonly found in low-level languages. |

Why do we need to distinguish so many data types? You can find the answer in courses like computer architecture and operating systems.

Run this code, and you will see the difference between `int` and `float`:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

const double pi = 3.1415;

int main(){
    float a{39.123 + pi};
    int b;
    std::cout << "a=" << " b=" << b << "\n";
    b = a;
    std::string message("The answer to everything is ");
    std::cout << message << std::to_string(b) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
a=42.2645 b=-113803110
The answer to everything is 42
```

$\rightarrow$ compile with -Wuninitialized<br>
$\rightarrow$ **always** initialize variables.


### 1.2 How to initialize basic data types?

```C++
int b=0;        // The classic way: variable = expression
int b(0);       // The classic way: variable( expression-list )
                // Basic types: =, Classes: constructor

int b{0};       // Since C++11: variable{ initializer-list }
int b{};        // Since C++11: Defaults to zero for int
```

<span style="color: blueviolet;">Core Guidelines</span>

[ES.23:](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#es23-prefer-the--initializer-syntax) Prefer the {}-initializer syntax
*The rules for* {} *initialization are simpler, more general, less ambiguous, and safer than for other forms of initialization. Use* = *only when you are sure that there can be no narrowing conversions. For built-in arithmetic types, use* = *only with auto. Avoid* () *initialization, which allows parsing ambiguities.*  

## 2 Built-in data types and numerical accuracy

### 2.1 Binary representation error 

```C++
const double pi=3.1415;
// ...
float a{39.123 + pi};
```

Multiple issues:

```bash
warning: conversion from 'double' to 'float' changes
value from '4.2264499999999998e+1' to '4.22644997e+1f'
[-Wfloat-conversion]
    8 | float a{39.123 + pi};
      |          ~~~~~~~^~~~
```

Why is a not 42.264**5**, as we would compute by hand?

### 2.2 Fixed-point notation and Floating-point notation

#### Fixed-point notation:
- Assume: 4 digits in the form xx.yy
  - Operation on data $\to$ cut off digits after xx.yy<br>
> > > > > a = 1.5;<br>b = a/2.0;<br>c = b/2.0;<br>d = c/2.0;<br>

<span style="color: orange;">Hands-on: </span>What is the value of `d`?

Exact representation: <i>b</i>=0.75, <i>c</i>=0.375, <i>d</i>=0.1875<br>
Fixed-point representation: `b=00.75  c=00.37  d=00.18`<br>
It is easy to realize the problem. Some bits in the integer part are not used, and some digits in the decimal part cannot be displayed.<br>

#### Floating-point notation:

- Fixed number of bits, split into **significant digits** (mantissa) and **exponent**.
- Normalization: $ab.cd\cdot10^4\to a.bcd\cdot10^5$
- First digit before comma in normalized binary form is always `1`<br>(nice: a free additional digit of precision!)
- Intotal: 1 bit for sign + *s* bits for significant digits + *e* bits for exponent

| Type | Sign | Exponent | Mantissa | Total bits |
|------|---|
| float | 1 | 8 | 23 | 32  | 
|double | 1 | 11 | 52 | 64 |

Standard: [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754). <br>
For example, 3,1415 (double):<br>
0\-10000000000\-1001001000011100101011000000100000110001001001101110

Also defines two additional/special values: `NaN` and `Inf`

### 2.3 Normalization and rounding errors

```C++
double a = 0.145e-07;
double b = 23.24e09;
double c = a + b;

std::cout << c << "\n";
```

<span style="color: orange;">Hands-on:</span> What is going to happen?

In some cases, rounding errors are very important. A classic example is [Vancouver Stock Exchange](https://www5.in.tum.de/~huckle/Vancouv.pdf)

### 2.4 Overview of built-in datatypes

| name       | min               | max               | size    |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| bool       | false             | true              | 1 Byte  |
| char       | 0                 | 255               | 1 Byte  |
| short int  | -32,768           | +32,768           | 2 Byte  |
| int        | -2,147,483,648    | +2,147,483,647    | 4 Byte  |
| long int   | -2,147,483,648    | +2,147,483,647    | 4 Byte  |
| float      | ≈ ±10e-37         | ≈ ±10e38          | 4 Byte  |
| double     | ≈ ±10e-307        | ≈ ±10e308         | 8 Byte  |

Additional modefier: **unsigned** (one extra bit)<br>
Limited size range $\to$ underflow and overflow (0, 1,...,254, 255, 0, 1,...)
For limits: see [numeric_limits<type>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits)

### 2.5 Fixed-width integer types
The sizes of `int` are [implementation-specific](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13398630/why-are-c-int-and-long-types-both-4-bytes/13398763#13398763)<br>
Types of specific number of bits:
`int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint8_t`, and many more ([list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer))

```C++
typedef int64_t MY_INT_TYPE;
using MY_UNSINGED_INT_TYPE = uint64_t;

std::cout << sizeof(MY_INT_TYPE) << "\n";
std::cout << sizeof(MY_UNSIGNED_INT_TYPE) << "\n";
```

`std::size_t`: Type that can store the maximum size of any object of any type. $\to$ Appropriate type for loop iterations and array sizes.

### 2.6 Implicit conversions

```C++
float a{39.123 + pi};
int b;
b = a;
```

```bash
warning: conversion from 'float' to 'int' may change value
[-Wfloat-conversion]
```

$\to$ When you intend to convert a type, use type castion: `static_cast<int>(a)`<br>
$\to$ Compile with `-Wconversion` (not covered by `-Wall` or `Wextra`)<br>
$\to$ Use a recent compiler!

### 2.7 Automatic type inference with `auto`

**The compiler knows better than the programmer**

```C++
int a1 = 3;
int b1 = 4;
auto c1 = a1 + b1; // yields int

double a2 = 3.0;
int b2 = 4;
auto c2 = a2 + b2; // yields double
```

Try it yourself. ╭( ･ㅂ･)و ̑̑ ＂

## 3. Memory organization, scope and lifetime

### 3.1 Memory organization

1. **Stack**:<br> - The stack is a linear data structure used to store local variables, function parameters, and return addresses of function calls.
2. **Heap**:<br> - The heap is a dynamically allocated memory area used to store data that is dynamically allocated during program execution.
3. **Global/Static Storage Area**:<br> - The global storage area holds global variables and static variables.
4. **Constant Storage Area**:<br> - The constant storage area is used to store constant values such as string literals.
5. **Code Area**:<br> - The code area stores the executable code of the program, including function bodies and instructions.

Did you know?
The stack data structure idea was proposed by Klaus Samelson
and Friedrich L. Bauer (TUM) in 1955.

### 3.2 Scope and lifetime

Variables live inside a scope: block scope, class scope, global scope,...

```C++
const double pi=3.1415;
int main(){
    float a{39.123 + pi};
    int b;
    std::cout << "a=" << a << " b=" << b << "\n";
    b = a;
    {
        std::size_t b = 1503;
        std::cout << "By the way, b = " << b << "\n";
    }
    std::string message("The answer to everything is ");
    std::cout << message << std::to_string(b) << "\n";
} // At the end of their scope, variables vanish.
```

## 4 Common types from the standard library

### 4.1 Strings

Special data type for text (from `<string>`):

```C++
std::string firstname = "James";
std::string lastname = "Bond";

std::cout << "My name is " << lastname << ". "
          << firstname + " " + lastname << ".\n";
```

Also provides functionality to compare strings, get substrings, etc (see [full list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string)).<br>
Under the hood: stored on the heap as an array of char.

Note: strings are always with `"double quotes"`,<br>
single characters are with single quotes `'c'`.

### 4.2 C++ containers 

Most data structures are collections of elements:
a shopping list may be represented as a list of strings.

- Common containers: `array`, `vector`, `map`
- Containers manage memory allocation for elements
- They also provide functionality to access elements, e.g., arr[1]
- Many functions are common among containers, e.g., size
