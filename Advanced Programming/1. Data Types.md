## 1.1 Initialization of variables

### What are data types?

"Data types" refer to the classification of data in computer science, specifying the type of values that data can hold, as well as the operations that can be performed on it. In most programming languages, data types can be categorized into the following common types:

| Data Type   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Integer     | Used to represent integer values, such as integer (int), long integer (long), short integer (short), etc. |
| Floating Point | Used to represent decimal values, such as single-precision floating point (float), double-precision floating point (double), etc. |
| Character   | Used to represent a single character, such as character (char). |
| Boolean     | Used to represent true or false, such as boolean(bool). |
| Array       | Used to store a collection of multiple elements of the same type. |
| Struct      | Used to store multiple data members of different types. |
| Enumeration | Used to define a set of symbol constants with a specific range of values.                             |
| Class       | Used to define a data structure that includes properties and methods. |
| Interface   | Used to define a specification of methods for classes to implement. |
| Pointer     | Used to store the memory address of a variable, commonly found in low-level languages. |

Why do we need to distinguish so many data types? You can find the answer in courses like computer architecture and operating systems.

Run this code, and you will see the difference between `int` and `float`:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

const double pi = 3.1415;

int main(){
    float a{39.123 + pi};
    int b;
    std::cout << "a=" << " b=" << b << "\n";
    b = a;
    std::string message("The answer to everything is ");
    std::cout << message << std::to_string(b) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

```
a=42.2645 b=-113803110
The answer to everything is 42
```
$\rightarrow$ compile with -Wuninitialized<br>
$\rightarrow$ **always** initialize variables.

### How to initialize basic data types?
```
int b=0;        // The classic way: variable = expression
int b(0);       // The classic way: variable( expression-list )
                // Basic types: =, Classes: constructor

int b{0};       // Since C++11: variable{ initializer-list }
int b{};        // Since C++11: Defaults to zero for int
```

<span style="color: blueviolet;">Core Guidelines</span>
[ES.23:](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#es23-prefer-the--initializer-syntax) Prefer the {}-initializer syntax
*The rules for* {} *initialization are simpler, more general, less ambiguous, and safer than for other forms of initialization. Use* = *only when you are sure that there can be no narrowing conversions. For built-in arithmetic types, use* = *only with auto. Avoid* () *initialization, which allows parsing ambiguities.*
