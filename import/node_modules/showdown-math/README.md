# Showdown Math

Add beautiful math equations to your Markdown files! This repository contains a small [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) extension. This extension turns Latex or [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/) in your markdown file into HTML tags. No JavaScript is needed to display the resulting equations. This extension relies on simple replacements using regular expressions, therefore escaping of the delimiters is not supported. This code is only tested outside the browser using Node version `v10.1.0`.

*Please report any issues!*

## Delimiters

To enter inline AsciiMath begin and end your text using a single percent sign: %. Non-inline math can be entered using two percent signs: %%. Likewise inline Latex can be inserted using a single dollar sign: $. Two dollar signs $$ will result in non-inline equations.

## Example

Here is a step-by-step example showing how to generate some equations. Let us start with an example Markdown file. Let's name it `example.md`.

```Markdown
This is a normal Markdown title
====================================

But oh! A wild AsciiMath equation appears: % 3 y^2 z - 5 z - 6 y^2 + 10 = 0 %.
You use factorization! It's super effective! The enemy turns into a non-inline Latex equation:
$$
(3y^2 + 5)(z - 2) = 0
$$

Now the solution is most easily expressed in non-inline AsciiMath:
%%
y = pm sqrt(5/3) \ vee \ z = 2
%%
```

We first need to install Showdown. 

```
npm install -g showdown
```

You might need to use sudo to run this command. However, a way to install packages without using sudo is [available](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md). Next up we install this extension.

```
npm install -g showdown-math
```

We can now easily convert the example file to HTML.

```
showdown makehtml -e showdown-math -i example.md -o example.html
```

The resulting example.html file will look weird! The produced HTML contains only the _body_ of the webpage. We still need to add a few other tags. We need to tell the browser the file is encoded in UTF-8 to make the Unicode characters work. Furthermore we need to link to the [Katex](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) CSS file. This way the equations will look good.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.9.0/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-TEMocfGvRuD1rIAacqrknm5BQZ7W7uWitoih+jMNFXQIbNl16bO8OZmylH/Vi/Ei" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- replace this line with the HTML produced by the last command -->
</body>
```

Now open the file using [the best browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and enjoy!
