## 1 Welcome

This lecture focuses on C++. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. If you have no idea what exactly C++ is, check wikipedia: [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

## 2 Von Neumann Architecture

- Control unit
- Arithmetic logic unit with processor registers (CPU)
- Memory for both data and instructions
- IO devices
- Bus: connects everything

## 3 Scientific Computing perspective

physical phenomena  $\overset{modeling}{\rightarrow}$ equation  $\overset{discretization}{\rightarrow}$ 
algorithm  $\overset{implementation}{\rightarrow}$ code

**Computational applications:**

- Computational Fluid Dynamics $\to$
- Fluid-Structure Interaction
- Molecular Dynamics
- Astrophysics
- Plasma Physics
- Quantum Computing
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Machine Learning (and more)

**What is special in Scientific Computing?**

- Small to very large scale computations
- Heterogeneous (parallel) hardware
- Sustainability

**Why C++?**
There are so many languages, why C++?

- C++ is very actively developed, modern C++ is easier
- compiled → fast
- statically typed → safe
- general-purpose (object-oriented, generic, functional, parallel, ...)
- large collection of numerical libraries
- compatible with C & Fortran → reuse numerical libraries

**But who uses C++?**
Scientific Computing projects in C++:

- Linear Algebra: Eigen, PETSc, Trilinos, Blaze
- PDE frameworks: OpenFOAM, deal.II, SU2, Dolfin (FEniCS)
- Molecular Dynamics: LAMMPS, GROMACS
- Machine Learning: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- large collection of numerical libraries
- More: elsa (tomographic reconstruction), SeqAn3 (biological sequence analysis), Atlas (climate modelling)
