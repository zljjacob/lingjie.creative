## Structure of this Lecture

The robotic lectures consist of two parts. In *Winter-Semester* : **Robotics**

where internal control of the robot is discussed: kinematics, robot
hardware and control (theoretical derivation of PID control structure).

In *Summer-Semester*, motion planning for the robot explaining how the desired trajectory for the internal control presented in Robotics is generated for manipulators and mobile platforms. This is presented in: **Robot Motion Planning**(This course)
