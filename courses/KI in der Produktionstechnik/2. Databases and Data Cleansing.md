## 1 Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)

**Overview**

![img](img/3-1.png)

The data passes through an operational data storage and requires cleansing to ensure the data quality before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting and analysis.

## 2 Learning Objectives

**Databases**

- Understanding how data can be stored in databases and data warehouses
- Understanding the structure of different databases
- Processing of database queries with standardized query language (SQL)

**Data Cleansing**

- Understanding the quality of data in the database
- Getting to know the workflow of data cleansing
- Understanding how data quality issues can be identified
- Getting familiar with the methods of data cleansing

## 3 Databases

Databases manage and access data efficiently.

### 3.2 Database Types

RDBMS are constantly being expanded, e.g. with object-oriented features, and are the most important DBMS.

NoSQL systems gain popularity especially for Big Data applications.

Relational DBMS dominate the market.

### 3.3 Relational Databases

Data is stored, changed, inserted and deleted in tables.

The logical **integrity** of a relational database is defined by the following conditions:

1. Each record in a table has a unique primary key value (entity integrity).
2. For each foreign key in the table T1. there is an identical key value in another table T2, which has been defined when T1 was created (referential integrity).
3. The remaining constraints are fulfilled (domain integrity).

The **primary key** is initially an attribute, or a combination of attributes of a table, that is **unique** for each record of the table.

A **foreign key** is an attribute or an attribute combination of a relation, which refers to a primary key (or key candidate) of another or the same relation.

Data integrity is a term for the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle.

**Relational representation of entity types**]

```
MEASUREMENTS: {[n_measurements: integer, inv_no: integer, meas_date: integer, ...]}
ROBOTS: {[rob_no: text, robot_type: text, inv_no: integer, SOP: integer, ...]}
ROBOT_BASEDATA: {[manufacturer: text, robot_type: text, a1_gearbox: text, a1_motor: text, ...]}
```

A table can refer to a column of another table by using a foreign key.

### 3.4 SQL

**SQL = Structured Query Language**

- Based on relational algebra
- Simple syntax
- Requires independence of the queries from the used DBMS.
- Interfaces to programming languages allow SQL commands to be transferred directly to a database system via a function call (e.g. via ODBC or JDBC).
- Even non-relational database systems are often equipped with an SQL-like interface.

DBMS languages are used to read, update and store data in a database and are specific to a particular data model. The dominant language is SQL.

For Big Data approaches NoSQL applications are often superior to RDBMS. However, for many database problems, the RDBMS remains the first choice.
