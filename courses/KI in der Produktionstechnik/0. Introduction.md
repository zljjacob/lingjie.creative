## 1 Introduction

**Definition of the Term Intelligence**

Natural intelligence

**Intelligence** has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as **the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors** within an environment or context. Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants.

The **intelligencer quotient (IQ)** is a **parameter** determined by an intelligence test **to evaluate intellectual performance** in general (general intelligence) or within a certain range (e.g, factors of intelligence) in comparison to a reference group. It always refers to a specific test, since there is no scientifically recognized, unambiguous definition of intelligence.
